          <h4>Eligibility criteria-</h4>
          ● Student of any department/year.
          Team specific details<br>
          ● 3 or 4 members per team.<br>
          ● Every participant must carry a valid college ID card.<br>
        <h5>  ROUND 1: Blindfolded Riddle Relay Challenge</h5>
          ● Every team is assigned a base that houses their precious flag, the key to victory.
          <br>● Teams are equipped with 8 balloons, to be strategically fastened to the back or waist of each player, as
          per the team's preference.
          <h6>Game Structure:</h6>
          • In a scenario with 8 teams, they are divided into two sets of 4 teams each.
         <br> • Successive players from each team take turns attempting to capture the flag from opponents
          during rounds.
         <br> • Players must seize the opportunity within a specified time limit before the next teammate enters
          the field.
         <h6> Flag Capture Mechanics:</h6>
          • To capture an opponent's flag, a player must first remove the attached balloon and use it to pop
          the opponent's balloon.
          <br>• Elimination occurs when both balloons are popped, forcing the player to exit the field.
          Defensive and Offensive Strategies:
         <br> • Players can choose between defending their flag or going on the offensive to capture flags from
          opponents.
          <br>• Strategic decision-making is crucial for success.
        <h6>Victory Determination:</h6>
          • The team with the highest number of captured flags advances to the next round.
          <br>• Accumulated flags determine the winner.
          Elimination and Flag Transfer:
          <br>• Eliminated players exit the field to reduce crowding.
          <br>• Flags carried by eliminated players become available for others to acquire.
        <h6>Optional Revival Feature:</h6>
          • In a twist of strategy, if the number of remaining balloons exceeds the number of players, they
          can be used to revive eliminated teammates.
        <h5>ROUND 2- GAME OF LIFE</h5>
          ● Real-life incorporation of the iconic 'Game of Life' board game.
         <br> ● Make strategic decisions, build your path as a team and embrace the unexpected twists that mirror
          the essence of the classic game.
          <br>● Each team will behave as an independent family where each member will have to enact as one of
          the family members and use their powers accordingly.
          <br>● Game will follow the same original game strategy like spinning the wheel, cash counter access,
          jackpot etc but with certain improvisations.
          <br>● Each step you take will land you to a certain task or challenge that has to be complicated within a
          certain time frame.
        <h5>ROUND 3- Ghoul's Gambit: The Escape Challenge</h5>
          ● Uncover the mysteries shrouded in an escape room and find a way to escape within the set
          time, all while facing spine-chilling scares and riddles.
          <br>● Creepy foyers, haunted portraits, cursed objects, haunted apparitions and eerie
          soundscapes will lead you to different nook and corners of the room.
          <br>● Decision has to be made by each team in such a way that they get to unlock the final clue
          and hence mark their victory.<br><br>
